A Python-based stochastic library for assessing geothermal power potential using the volumetric
method in a liquid-dominated reservoir.

ABSTRACT
===============================
We present a Python-based stochastic library for assessing geothermal power
potential using the volumetric method in a liquid-dominated reservoir.
The specific aims of this study are to use the volumetric method, ``heat in
place,`` to estimate electrical energy production ability from a geothermal
liquid-dominated reservoir, and to build a Python-based stochastic library
with useful methods for running such simulations. Although licensed
software is available, we selected the open-source programming language
Python for this task. The Geothermal Power Potential Evaluation stochastic
library (``gppeval``) is structured as three essential objects including a
geothermal power plant module, a Monte Carlo simulation module, and a tools
module. In this study, we use hot spring data from the municipality of
Nombre de Jesus, El Salvador, to demonstrate how the ``gppeval`` can be used to
assess geothermal power potential. Frequency distribution results from the
stochastic simulation shows that this area could initially support a
9.16-MWe power plant for 25 years, with a possible expansion to 17.1 MWe.
Further investigations into the geothermal power potential will be
conducted to validate the new data.

For testing the application, a **Jupyter Notebook** example has been included in the `example
folder`_.

*HINT*: **Now, this application is available for Python 3.5**

INSTALLATION
============

Required Packages
-----------------

The following packages should be installed automatically (if using 'pip'
or 'easy_install'), otherwise they will need to be installed manually:

- NumPy_ : Numeric Python
- SciPy_ : Scientific Python
- Matplotlib_ : Python plotting library
- Mcerp_ : Monte Carlo Error Propagation
- Beautifultable_ : Utility package to print visually appealing ASCII tables to terminal

How to install
--------------

You have **several easy, convenient options** to install the 'gppeval'
package (administrative privileges may be required).

#. Simply copy the unzipped 'gppeval folder' directory to any other location that
   python can find it and rename it 'gppeval'.

#. From the command-line, do one of the following:

   a. Manually download the package files below, unzip to any directory, and
      run:

       $ [sudo] python setup.py install

   b. If 'pip' is installed, run the follow command (stable version and internet connection is required)

       $ [sudo] pip install [--upgrade] gppeval

CHANGES OF NEW ISSUE
====================

#. gppeval (2019.4.17.0.3.dev1).
    Fixed bugs using "print" on Python 2.7

#. gppeval (2019.4.17.0.2.dev1).
    Python 3.5 available

#. gppeval (2018.10.11.0.1.dev1).
    The input file csv has been modified. It includes the possibility of using volume as a input
    reservoir parameter. Using the word ``none`` is possible to exchange between either to use
    **Area** and **Thickness** or to use only **Volume** as a reservoir geometric parameter.

    Example: Using Area and Thickness

        0,Name,14.00061,-88.73744,ReservoirArea,A,km2,5,6,7,0,0,T
        1,,,,Thickness,h,m,450,500,600,0,0,T
        2,,,,Volume,v,km3,4,6,8.2,0,0,none

    Example: Using only Volume

        0,Name,14.00061,-88.73744,ReservoirArea,A,km2,5,6,7,0,0,None
        1,,,,Thickness,h,m,450,500,600,0,0,None
        2,,,,Volume,v,km3,4,6,8.2,0,0,T

#. gppeval (2018.4.6.0.1.dev1).
    Original issue after have been upload as a stable.
